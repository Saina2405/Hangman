   # Description
> A Hangman Game On Python is about guessing letters (A-Z) to form the words. If the player guesses the  right letter that is within the word, the letter appears at its correct position. The player has 5 turns to guess the word and he/she has to guess the correct word until a man is hung, then the game is over.
